# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

For this week's challenge, we had the task to take starter code and refactor the code to make an existing site more accessible and clean up the code on the way. The exisiting site for this challenge is a Horiseon webpage that has a functional navigational header, main content, sidebar content, and a footer.

## User Story and Acceptance Criteria

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
